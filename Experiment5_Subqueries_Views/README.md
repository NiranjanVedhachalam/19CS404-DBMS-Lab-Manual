# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
--
Write a SQL query that retrieves the all the columns from the Table Grades, where the grade is equal to the minimum grade achieved in each subject.

Sample table: GRADES (attributes: student_id, student_name, subject, grade)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Grades g
WHERE grade = (
    SELECT MIN(grade)
    FROM Grades
    WHERE subject = g.subject
);

```

**Question 2**
---
From the following tables, write a SQL query to find all the orders generated in New York city. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id and salesman_id.

SALESMAN TABLE

name               type
-----------        ----------
salesman_id  numeric(5)
name             varchar(30)
city                 varchar(15)
commission   decimal(5,2)

ORDERS TABLE

name            type
----------      ----------
ord_no          int
purch_amt    real
ord_date       text
customer_id  int
salesman_id  int

```sql
SELECT
    T1.ord_no,
    T1.purch_amt,
    T1.ord_date,
    T1.customer_id,
    T1.salesman_id
FROM
    orders AS T1 
INNER JOIN
    salesman AS T2
ON
    T1.salesman_id = T2.salesman_id
WHERE
    T2.city = 'New York';
```
